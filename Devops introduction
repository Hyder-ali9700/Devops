                                                                WHAT IS THE DEVOPS ? LETS EXPLAIN

for example you are very hungry and you want to order some food and you have 2 application first swiggy second zomato 
you want to order Biryani and Biryani price is 100 
     swiggy                         zomato
20 minutes to delivery       30 minutes take to delivery
so which one will you pick ? difinitely swiggy
same like methological devops
so we have waterfall and scream and agile and devops
Devops        other
1 year        2 year
so in order to delivery on application very speedly in to the market 
so reason we choose to Devops 
why devops ?
in software domain  we have 2 teams 
Development |  operation
plan        |  deploy
code        |  operation
build       |  monitoring
test        |
...................................................................................................................................
As devops engineer your main gaol is the deployments
after that we need to operate the application and finally we need to monitor 
monitor means how are application is running 
how my application is behaving by using thousand to million users use application so how behaving my application so like that 
....................................................................................................................................
what we call us SDLC 
SDLC means software development life cycle
so in  SDLC has 2 teams 
team number one is development team and team number two operation 
what does development team to do 4 things to do and what does operation has to do 3 thing
Development |  operation
plan        |  deploy
code        |  operation
build       |  monitoring
test        |
......................................................................................................................................
in devops we use the 12 tools 
1 git
2 github
3 maven
4 jenkins
5 ansible
6 docker 
7 kubernetes
8 teraform
9 nagios
10 sonarqube
11 j frog 
12 nexus 
......................................................................................................................................
                                                                           SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

software architecture consists of 
1 tier
2 tier
3 tier
N tier     architectures
a tier can also be referred to as a layer
( tier = layer = server )
tree layer are involved in the application 
layers names
1 presentation layer
2 business layer
3 data layer 
lets see  each layer in details 
                                                                            PRESENTATION LAYER
it is also known as the client  layer the top layer of an application this is the layer we use 
whene we use the software by using this layer we can access web pages 
the main function of this layer is to communicate with the application layer this layer passes the information 
which is given by the use in term  of keyboard action mouse click to the application layer
[in simple words it is to view the application]

                                                                            APLICATION LAYER
it is also known as business logic layer which is also known as the logical layer 
it controls an application functionality by performing  details processing  the layer act
in simple words it is to view the application
as a meditor between the presentation and database layers complite business logic will be written in this layer 
[in simple words it is to perform operation on the application]

                                                                              DATA LAYER
the data is stored in this layer
in application layer communicates with the database layer to retrieve  the data 
it contains methods that connect the database and performs required action E G insert update delete etc
in simple words it is to share and retrieve the data 

NOTE interview questions give the answers in simple words 
it is to view the application]
it is to perform operation on the application 
it is to share and retrieve the data

PRESENTATION LAYER                   APPLICATION LAYER                          DATA LAYER
client/user layer top layer          business/logic layer middle layer          database layer last laye                        
access web pages                     to use application                         to store and retrieve data
