                                                                                MAVEN
INTERVIEW QUESTION 
maven is build tool
maven home path is  = .m2
maven main file is  = pim.xml
maven dependency on = java
=====â‰ ====================================
Maven can build any number of projects into desired output such as ,jar ,war and ,ear
jar = java archive file
war = web archive file
ear = enterpriss archive file
. it is mostly  used for java based projects 
. it was initially released on 13 july 2004
. maven is written in java
======================================================================================================================                                                                               
JAVA --> COMPILE --> .CLASS --> COMPRESS --> JAR

java   =  raw code                              java archive = jar = backend
class  =  executable file                       web archive = war = frontend + backend
jar    =  group of .class files                 enterprise archive = ear = jar + war
========================================================================================================================
1 > generate resource     =    mvn archetype:generate
2 > compile code          =    mvn compile 
3 > unit test             =    mvn test
4 > package build         =    mvn package
5 > install (into local repo or artifactory)   =  mvn install
6 > deploy (to server)
7 > clean (to delete all the runtime files)    =  mvn clean
===================================================================================================================
                                                  PRACTICAL
type on google --> dlcdn.apache.org --> you will be see maven select maven --> maven version 3 
--> 3.6.3 --> binaries --> copy tar .gz link and came to local
1/:wget paste the link here
2/:ll 
3/:tar -zxvf apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz --> just type a automatically came this  apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz
4/:cd just a type
5/:yum install java 1.8.0-openjdk -y
6/:java -version
7/:yum install maven -y
8/:maven --version
9/:mvn archetype:generate --> project structure will come automatically
.group id = devops
.artifactid means project name = swiggy
.version snapshoot --> skip or if you give any number so give
.package --> hyder 
10/:ll
11/:yum install tree
12/:cd swiggy
13/:ll --> you can see pom.xml
14/:tree
15/:mvn compile --> to get .class in target folder  target folder automatically came
16/:mvn test --> to get AppTest.class replace AppTest,java
17/:mvn package --> to get jar   you can see   swiggy -1.0-SNAPSHOOT.jar
18/:mvn install --> to copying to maven home path    what is the maven home path ?   .m2 is home path of maven
19/:mvn clean --> to delete all but pom.xml or plugin still in
==============================================================================================================
but in real life use this
:mvn clean package --> automatically came all compile test install like this
===============================================================================================================
